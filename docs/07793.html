I’ve done work for CCTV in the past, and most of my translation clients have some sort of government ties. Overall, I think that the daily news (新闻联播) that gets presented on CCTV is generally objective when it comes to international news. However, when it comes to domestic Chinese news, there can be more of an agenda. Having been a regular consumer of 新闻联播 before, I’m well aware of how the program will often shape a story to be very pro-China, and will often do fluff pieces on important figures.</p><p id="8c5c" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">But as a Data Scientist, I wanted to perform an exploration of this, and see if there were any recognizable trends in how many fluff pieces (for Xi Jinping in particular) are produced over time.</p><h2 id="9cb8" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">The Dataset</h2><p id="2681" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki lu jr kk kl lv ju kn ko lw kq kr ks lx ku kv kw ly ky kz la ij bi">The dataset I’m using was found on Kaggle, and features every written news article published for use on the 新闻联播 program between January 1, 2016 to October 15, 2018. It has 4 columns: Date, Tag, Headline, and Content.</p><p id="3368" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">The Tag column differentiates the rows in the dataset between ““详细全文” some relatively long news, “国内“ domestic short news, “国际“ international short news.”<br/><br/><strong class="kh ir">Project Goals:</strong></p><ol class=""><li id="6745" class="lz ma iq kh b ki kj kl km ko mb ks mc kw md la me mf mg mh bi translated">Explore whether there is any sort of trend in positive news/fluff pieces about Xi Jinping (especially surrounding the time of the constitutional change).</li><li id="1d6c" class="lz ma iq kh b ki mi kl mj ko mk ks ml kw mm la me mf mg mh bi translated">Come up with a way to predict whether a piece will be about Xi Jinping.</li><li id="e718" class="lz ma iq kh b ki mi kl mj ko mk ks ml kw mm la me mf mg mh bi translated">Create a filter for fluff pieces about Xi Jinping (sometimes it can feel like you are being bombarded by propaganda)(future work )</li></ol><h2 id="6420" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">Data Exploration and Code</h2><p id="5968" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki lu jr kk kl lv ju kn ko lw kq kr ks lx ku kv kw ly ky kz la ij bi translated">To get started, here’s a list of all the imports that were used in this project:</p><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi mn"><img src="../Images/897753f1601232ade2ed2f239d9f95b7.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*0oL6LBBpzvoNBEFK-KH32w.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="4977" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">Most of these are fairly standard for NLP, but one package that some might be unfamiliar with is <a class="ae mz" href="https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank">jieba</a>. Jieba is a popular tokenizer specifically for Chinese characters, and typically does a great job parsing which should be compound characters and which should not. It also allows you to add custom tokenization rules pretty easily, if something isn’t parsing quite right.</p><p id="db48" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">And this is typically what the data looked like:</p><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi na"><img src="../Images/90e55a59305619823d3b637605180362.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*kyuhJgo9vPMoYaa4d4eSSA.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="f5fa" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">It had 20,738 rows with only 100 or so stories that repeated. Since these were all stories that did actually air, I decided to leave them in.</p><h2 id="19ca" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">Non-NLP Feature Engineering</h2><p id="3e50" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki lu jr kk kl lv ju kn ko lw kq kr ks lx ku kv kw ly ky kz la ij bi translated">Before getting to the NLP aspect of the project, I wanted to see if there was perhaps an increase in Xi Jinping-friendly stories surrounding times when there may typically be negative public sentiment about him (specifically in March, when he changed to constitution to remove presidential term limits). This required me to “manually” determine if each news story was about Xi, an arduous task with over 20,000 rows of data.<br/> <br/> So I counted the ratio of mentions of Xi Jinping (or Chairman Xi, Secretary Xi, etc.) to the character count of an article, getting the percentage he was mentioned, and cross-referenced articles with high “Xi counts” with whether or not he is mentioned in the title.</p><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi nb"><img src="../Images/339a60715a2d43cf5db2958e24478ed5.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*7_ciscMVnpwobmxx4SWOTA.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="a791" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">This was typically a good enough measure for whether an article was truly about Xi or not, which allowed me to tag it (for later use by NLP classifiers). I did do a manual count of about 2,000 rows, and found 33 false positives. Logically, I didn’t see how an article could be about Xi Jinping without actually mentioning him, so wasn’t worried about false negatives in articles with a Xi count of 0.0, and 33/2000 false positives is a good enough error that the rule seems alright.</p><h2 id="4f0c" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">Results</h2><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi nc"><img src="../Images/4cfe989c6a84dd6abae6249d012ac2ed.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tdYOuTbI93J_TcESiOh1RQ.png"/></div></div></figure><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div class="gh gi nd"><img src="../Images/feffb880355c4d896d780cdae26fa526.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1074/format:webp/1*fSjjUJqN6ZCxV_TVEpB1zQ.png"/></div></figure><p id="256d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">We can see that the number of articles about Xi Jinping varies throughout the year, but has generally been on the rise in 2018. However, the rise for the time period around March specifically could just be random variation. If we had another year of data, it would be interesting to see if this rise continued, or if it was simply a slightly larger increase than the normal variation we see throughout the seasons of the rest of the years. 2.5 years isn’t really a long enough time to observe definite trends in something as abstract as whether the media is trying to promote more positive pieces about the President.</p><h2 id="c079" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated"><strong class="ak">Predictions with NLP Classifiers</strong></h2><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi ne"><img src="../Images/cf71f990bf19816d10dc78e46b68e195.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Z_5wmLvj7iOpyyIdErDKpA.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="2675" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">The dictionary keeping track of all the values was rather long, so I cut it down to only record words/phrases that appeared 20 times or more. Some of the top words we see throughout the dataset are ‘发展’ (development), ‘中国’ (China), ‘习近平’ (Xi Jinping), ‘合作’ (cooperation), etc. This isn’t very surprising for a dataset of Chinese mainstream news articles.</p><p id="55f5" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated"><strong class="kh ir">Methodology</strong><br/><br/>I was able to train NLTK's basic Naive Bayes classifier using all 12,000+ characters as a feature set, but ran into memory issues when training other classifiers, so ended up using just the top 5,000 character combinations as features. All 20,738 of the articles were shuffled using random.shuffle, then the first 15,000 were used to train, resulting in roughly a 72/28 split for training and testing.</p><h2 id="2be6" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">NLP Results</h2><p id="962a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki lu jr kk kl lv ju kn ko lw kq kr ks lx ku kv kw ly ky kz la ij bi">The first pass with all 12,000 characters as a featureset is interesting to examine because of the changes that occurred when less characters were used. Most notably, some of the figures that strongly indicate an article is about Xi Jinping are different, and both 检阅台 (review/inspection platform) and 挥手致意 (waving to express regards/respect) are absent in 5k-character featureset’s list of most informative features. Both of these terms (highlighted in red) are almost exclusively used during a review of the troops (typically done by Xi Jinping).</p><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi nf"><img src="../Images/2096f6dc43994e0339a9674870c79b9f.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*0QMuR7MCRZ6hDIahHA-HYQ.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="91c1" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">And the most informative people (in order) were:</p><p id="24b0" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Ding Xuexiang 丁薛祥 (General Secretary of the CPC)</p><p id="0678" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Yang Jiechi 杨洁篪 (Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs)</p><p id="1d23" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Fang Fenghui 房峰辉 (Former Chief of Joint Staff)</p><p id="0e0d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Ma Xiaotian 马晓天 (Former Deputy Chief of Joint Staff)</p><p id="20cd" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Zhao Keshi 赵克石 (Former Nanjing Commander)</p><p id="f9ca" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">In the second pass, with a 5,000-character featureset, we see that 丁薛祥 (Ding Xuexiang, Xi Jinping’s aide) and 杨洁篪 (Yang Jiechi, a key leader of China’s foreign policy) are found in both featuresets. Interestingly, it appears that Xi Jinping himself (highlighted in green) appears throughout the dataset so much that he is 45 times more likely to appear in articles that aren’t actually about him. The 中央办公厅 (the General Office of the CPC, highlighted in red) is also present in this featureset’s 25 most important features, but was absent in the previous version’s most important features.</p><figure class="mo mp mq mr gt ms gh gi paragraph-image"><div role="button" tabindex="0" class="mt mu di mv bf mw"><div class="gh gi ng"><img src="../Images/8db513d35227a68f9d862988e9f1df69.png" data-original-src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*Dj1ZmsYIo6P8nnAno5AVGg.png"/></div></div></figure><p id="783a" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">And the most informative people (in order) this time were:</p><p id="fc3d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Ding Xuexiang 丁薛祥 (General Secretary of the CPC)</p><p id="5538" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Yang Jiechi 杨洁篪 (Director of the Office of Foreign Affairs)</p><p id="d554" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Liu He 刘鹤 (Vice Premier of the People’s Republic of China)</p><p id="e08d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi">Wang Huning 王沪宁 (Chinese political leader)</p><p id="2f7d" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">Purely by looking at how likely these people/features were to indicate whether a story was about Xi Jinping, we can see the importance of certain politicians that might not often appear in the public eye.</p><h2 id="3a51" class="lb lc iq bd ld le lf dn lg lh li dp lj ko lk ll lm ks ln lo lp kw lq lr ls lt bi translated">Models</h2><p id="c310" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki lu jr kk kl lv ju kn ko lw kq kr ks lx ku kv kw ly ky kz la ij bi translated">The baseline of this dataset was 89.787%, which is relatively high, but it turns out most of the articles in the dataset were not about Xi Jinping.</p><p id="3164" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">Here’s how each of the classifiers I used performed:<br/>1.

I learned a lot more than mentioned in this post, and will write about unsupervised LDA models for parsing Chinese once I have performed some more exploration. As for this project, the next step could be to turn it into a filter of Xi Jinping-related news, or apply the techniques used here to filter out any topic one could want. It could also be used to draw a map of relationships in the CPC based on the proximity of certain political figures to Xi Jinping. It is also one step along the way of defining that vague concept of what it means for an article to be “about” someone or something, and handling it in a way that computers can understand.</p><p id="ec3f" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated"><strong class="kh ir">本文中使用的所有代码和可视化都可以在这里获得:</strong> <a class="ae mz" href="https://github.com/razzlestorm/Lambda-Build-One" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> GitHub </a></p><p id="02ed" class="pw-post-body-paragraph kf kg iq kh b ki kj jr kk kl km ju kn ko kp kq kr ks kt ku kv kw kx ky kz la ij bi translated">如果你有任何关于用中文争论/分析数据的问题，请随时通过<a class="ae mz" href="http://www.linkedin.com/in/jerimiah-willhite" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank"> LinkedIn </a>联系我！</p></div></div>
